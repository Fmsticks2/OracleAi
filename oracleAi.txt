AI Oracle Network - Product Requirements Document
Executive Summary
Project Name: OracleAI (or similar)
Tagline: "Resolve prediction markets in seconds, not days"
Platform: BNB Chain
Timeline: 4 weeks (Hackathon MVP)
Vision
Transform prediction market infrastructure by providing instant, AI-powered oracle resolution for
objective events, reducing settlement time from 24-48 hours to under 1 minute while maintaining
accuracy and decentralization.
Problem Statement
Current Pain Points
1. Slow Resolution: UMA's Optimistic Oracle takes 24-48 hours to settle markets
2. Capital Inefficiency: Traders' funds locked during dispute periods
3. Poor UX: Users wait days to claim winnings, killing engagement
4. Market Limitations: Slow oracles prevent time-sensitive markets (live sports, breaking news)
5. Vulnerability Window: Long dispute periods increase manipulation risk in low-liquidity markets
Market Opportunity
- Polymarket processes $2B+ monthly volume but relies on slow oracles
- CZ identified prediction market oracles as key opportunity area
- Sports betting market alone: $200B+ annually
- Real-time resolution unlocks new market categories
Solution Overview
Core Product
An AI-powered oracle network that:
1. Instantly verifies objective outcomes using multi-source data aggregation
2. Provides confidence scoring for resolution quality
3. Escalates uncertainty to human arbitrators or UMA OO fallback
4. Operates on BNB Chain with cross-chain compatibility
5. Generates revenue through per-resolution fees
Key Innovation
Multi-agent AI system that cross-references multiple data sources (APIs, web scraping, social
media) to achieve consensus on objective outcomes with cryptographic proof of verification
process.

Appendix
A. Sample Event Types (MVP)
Sports:
- "Did the Lakers win on Nov 8, 2025?" → Verify ESPN/TheScore/NBA.com
- "Was the final score Lakers 115 - Warriors 110?" → Exact score verification
Crypto:
- "Was BTC above $50,000 on Nov 8, 2025 at 12pm UTC?" → CoinGecko/CMC APIs
- "Did ETH reach $3,000 this week?" → Historical price data
Elections:
- "Who won the mayoral race in NYC?" → AP Election API verification
B. Confidence Scoring Logic
Confidence = (Source Agreement × 0.6) + (Source Quality × 0.3) + (Timeliness × 0.1)
Source Agreement: % of sources agreeing on outcome
Source Quality: Weighted score based on source reputation
Timeliness: Recency of data (<1hr = 100%, >24hr = 50%)
Resolution Action:
- >90% confidence → Instant resolution with 2hr challenge window
- 70-90% confidence → 12hr challenge window
- <70% confidence → Escalate to UMA OO or human arbitrators
C. Gas Cost Estimates (BNB Chain)
- Market registration: ~50,000 gas (~$0.10)
- Resolution submission: ~80,000 gas (~$0.15)
- Challenge initiation: ~60,000 gas (~$0.12)
- Finalization: ~40,000 gas (~$0.08)
Total per market: ~$0.45 (vs. UMA's ~$5-10 on Ethereum)
D. Demo Script Outline (5 min)
0:00-0:30: Problem (show Polymarket 48hr wait, capital locked)
0:30-1:30: Solution walkthrough (architecture diagram, AI agents)
1:30-3:00: Live demo (resolve real event in <60s, show proof)
3:00-4:00: Dashboard tour (analytics, speed comparison, revenue)
4:00-4:30: Technical highlights (smart contracts, BNB Chain)
4:30-5:00: Vision & roadmap (market opportunity, post-hackathon)
Conclusion
OracleAI addresses the 1 priority identified by YZi Labs and CZ: fast, reliable oracle resolution
for prediction markets. By combining AI agents with cryptographic proofs and BNB Chain's
efficiency, we enable instant market settlement while maintaining decentralization and accuracy.
Key Differentiators:
1. 100x faster than UMA OO (30s vs. 48h)
2. Multi-source AI verification with proof
3. Clear revenue model ($1M+ ARR potential)
4. Built on BNB Chain (low fees, fast finality)
5. Fallback to UMA OO for edge cases
This positions us to win the hackathon and build a sustainable, high-impact business in the
prediction market infrastructure space.
